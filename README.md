# NestJS Starter App ðŸš€

A boilerplate NestJS application pre-configured with common best practices, tools, and integrations for rapid development.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Custom Validation Pipe (Laravel-like)**
  - Instead of returning an array of validation errors (default NestJS behavior), it returns a key-value pair structure.
  - Example output:
    ```json
    // Throws Unprocessable Entity (422)
    {
      "errors": {
        "email": "The email field is required",
        "password": "The password must be at least 6 characters"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Docker Setup**
  - Ready-to-use Docker configuration for both **development** and **testing** environments.

- **Caching with Redis**
  - Integrated `cache-manager` with Redis support for improved performance.

- **Prisma as Database ORM**
  - Uses **Prisma** instead of TypeORM.
  - Includes a **custom Database Service** with `reset()` helper for testing.

- **Custom Logger (Winston)**
  - Structured logging using `winston` with support for different log levels and transports.

- **Custom Response Interceptor**
  - Provides consistent response formatting across all endpoints.

- **Sentry Integration**
  - 3rd-party error tracking with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).

- **Testing Setup**
  - Pre-installed with `jest-mock-extended` for more powerful and type-safe mocking.
